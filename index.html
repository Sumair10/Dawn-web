            <p class="para">Switzerland plans to make its first “cautious steps” towards ending its coronavirus lockdown next month, the government has said, contrasting with neighbours that are sticking with many restrictions. <br><br>

                In the first step, shops, museums and libraries are due to reopen from March 1. Zoos, gardens and sports facilities will also be reopened, with a final decision to come on Feb 24, according to Reuters. <br><br>
                
                “The efforts of the last few months are now paying off, the population has been very disciplined,” said Health Minister Alain Berset. <br><br>
                
                “New infections have halved within a month, so the situation is not so bad. We would all like to do more activities again, such as sports.”
